<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

![Home Page image](shop/static/img/homepageSite.png)

This project, realized for educational purposes, regards building a decentralized eco-friendly shoe shop putting its products up for charity auctions, handled by an ethereum 
[smart contract](https://ropsten.etherscan.io/address/0xb49468a4560f4929211d7e968b8b16f81562831b)
(deployed on Ropsten Testnet) where users can interact with it to bid and auctioneers can create new auctions, whose receipts are stored in the contract once ended.
Moreover, a website, created with a web framework (in this case [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/)) using Redis for cache and SQLite as main db, provides online store infrastructure and enables users to interact with the smart contract functionalities, using MetaMask as wallet and provider.

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

Once you set your environment, to run the server locally you just need to:
* Initialize the database only one time by executing these commands from your prompt (assuming you're in folder project directory (shop folder): "python manage.py makemigrations" and "python manage.py migrate".
* Activate and connect to a redis server. If you are on windows, open your linux extension (for instance Ubuntu LTS) and execute the command "redis-server".
* Run on your command prompt "python manage.py runserver" and go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/ on your browser. 

I hope you enjoy it ;).
